I am not very sure what i want to do in my futur, but there are many things that catch my atention. First, I 
would love to be able to play sports at a proffesional level. I would do this by working hard and always trying
yo be better. Another thing that I would love to do is go to collegde with a scholorship because of sports. With 
i would study biolagy, and study to become a veteranarian. These are two options are what i would wantv to do, 
but i am not sure and have time to think about this topic.
