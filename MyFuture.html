<p>
I am not very sure what i want to do in my future, but there are many things that catch my atention. First, I 
would love to be able to play soccer at a proffesional level. Preferably a league in europe but, i think that the mls would be fine.I would do this by working hard and always trying
to be better. Another thing that I would love to do is go to collegde with a scholorship because of sports. With 
i would study biolagy, and study to become a veteranarian. If i choose to study to becaome a vet i would love to attend Stanfard University. THis school is known for its good academics. Also, its succes in sports, especially soccer. These are two options are what i would wantv to do, 
but i am not sure and have time to think about this topic.
