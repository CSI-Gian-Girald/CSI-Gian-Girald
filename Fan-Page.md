    Lionel Messi is an inspirational person to many kids and adults. He is an argentinian born soccer player. He is very technical with the ball, it's almost impossible to take the ball away from him. He has played for three diffrent teams wich are: Argentinas national team, Barcelona, and Paris Sain German. He is inspirational towards me because of everything he has gone through to be where he is today, "The Goat"

Messi in my eyes is the goat but there is one player that people can argue. This is Cristiano Ronaldo. Him and messi have been the best players in the world for over 5 years. They have both won many awards and have had great team success. THis is a valid argument but at the end of the day they are both greats in the sport of futbol.
